==========< GAMEPLAY NOTES >==========

COMBO SYSTEM
 - Normal attacks can be chained in this order: X, A, Y, B, Z, C
 - Normal attacks can be canceled into any Special and Super moves even if they miss
 - Special moves can be canceled into any Super moves even if they miss


DAMAGE SCALING
 - The damage your attacks inflict goes down as the total combo damage goes up
 - At 0 combo damage, they deal full damage
 - At 500 combo damage, they deal the minimum 10% damage
 - The amount of power gained during a combo is also affected by damage scaling


THROWS
 - Throws cannot be blocked but can be jumped out of
 - The opponent can escape a normal throw by inputting a throw of their own just as they are grabbed
 - Normally throws can only be escaped if the opponent was in a position where they could also attempt to throw


RUN
 - Can be interrupted with any attack


BACK DASH
 - Creates some space between you and the opponent
 - Considered airborne, so it avoids most throws and standing combos


SUPER JUMP
 - Marvel VS Capcom style jump


POWER CHARGE
 - Manually charges the power meter
 - Rate of charge is slow at first, but increases the longer you hold it


GUARD CANCEL
 - While guarding, this cancels out of the guarding pose with a counterattack
 - Subtracts 300 points from the guard bar (if guard break is enabled)
 - Cannot be used to finish off the opponent
 - Useful to relieve pressure


FALL RECOVERY
 - Allows you to land on your feet after being knocked down
