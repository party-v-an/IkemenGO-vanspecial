GHETTO WARMACHINE by MelvanaInChains
voiced by (mostly): Reginald Dyson

Biography:
A man of unknown identity hiding behind a false armor of 'hood cred'. He lived in a ghetto neighborhood throughout the majority of his life, and it was gradually having a
devestating effect on him. As he tried to go on to make something of himself, the constant aura around him insisted on sapping every last bit of life from him until he
became a rambling husk of a man who yells about money and all that shit a lot. And eventually, all of this came into motion, and he donned an armor of bling and cashmoniez to
protect his physical self from everyone around him; as mentally, he had already passed on.

With a mere shred of his humanity, he struggles to find someone or some way to save himself from the hell that has been imposed on him ever since he saw the 'light' of life.
