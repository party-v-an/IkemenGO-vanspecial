; This is a record of the variables that Terrance uses. Holy hell I didn't think I'd end up using quite so many.
; Variables used by helpers are also given a unique ID as I don't tend to use too many variables, and this makes searching for them easier (Granted the Arxos Guarding AI also has a set of their own).
