==========< MOVE DETAILS >==========

 - Necro Desire is an overhead

 - Ecstatic Climb can be cancelled into a jump

 - Finishing Shower can be aimed up or down with the respective direction

 - Eternal Slumber is unblockable. It causes a little damage but a lot of stun



==========< GAMEPLAY NOTES >==========

COMBO SYSTEM
 - Some Normal attacks can be canceled into any Special and Super moves
 - Some Special moves can be canceled into any Super moves
 - Some Super moves can be canceled into different Super moves
 - Cancelling a Special or Super move into a Super move resets the juggle points


DAMAGE SCALING
 - The damage your attacks inflict goes down with each attack in a combo
 - The first attack deals 100% damage
 - Successive attacks deal 10% less damage
 - Super cancelling a special advances 2 steps in the damage scaling
 - Super cancelling a super advances 3 steps in the damage scaling
 - Super Combo damage will not fall below 30% for Level 1, 40% for Level 2 and 50% for Level 3
 - Damage during Dark Force works the same, but multiplied by 133%
 - The amount of power gained during a combo is also affected by damage scaling


THROWS
 - Throws cannot be blocked but can be jumped out of
 - The opponent can escape a normal throw by inputting a throw of their own just as they are grabbed
 - Normally throws can only be escaped if the opponent was in a position where they could also attempt to throw


COUNTER HITS
 - If the opponent is in the middle of attacking, your attacks deal 20% extra damage
 - Most attacks cause extra hit stun as well, allowing links that are normally not possible
 - You'll know a counter hit happened when a round shockwave effect appears at the point of impact


KNOCKDOWNS
 - This character uses 3 types of knockdowns: Soft, Medium and Hard
 - Soft knockdowns allow the enemy to use fall recovery or fast recovery (mash buttons to get up)
 - Medium knockdowns allow only fast recovery
 - Hard knockdowns allow neither. The enemy will always get up with the same timing
 - Hard knockdowns are signalled by a lifebar message (if the lifebars allow it)


FLIGHT
 - Morrigan is special in that she can fly instead of dashing or running
 - Holding up or down changes flight trajectory
 - Can be interrupted with any attack


HIGH JUMP
 - Useful for quickly closing distance
 - If the opponent is in the corner, this allows you to cross them up


SIDESTEP
 - Avoids all attacks and fireballs
 - Vulnerable to throws
 - Instant recovery


SIDESTEP ATTACK
 - Allows you to counterattack after dodging
 - Between the punch and kick options, one can be cancelled into special and super moves, and the other knocks down


ROLL
 - Avoids all attacks and fireballs while moving
 - Vulnerable to throws
 - Can be hit by anything at the end of the animation
 - Forward version is a bit faster than the back version


PARRY
 - Allows you to bypass block stun, leaving the opponent open for a counterattack
 - To parry high attacks tap forward just before being hit. To parry low attacks tap down. While jumping only forward works


POWER CHARGE
 - Manually charges the power meter
 - Rate of charge is slow at first, but increases the longer you hold it


GUARD CANCEL
 - While guarding, this cancels out of the guarding pose with a counterattack
 - Subtracts 300 points from the guard bar (if guard break is enabled)
 - Cannot be used to finish off the opponent
 - Useful to relieve pressure


DARK FORCE (ASTRAL VISION)
 - Morrigan creates a double that copies every attack of hers
 - Projectile limit is lifted
 - Soul Fist becomes better at juggling
 - Can still use EX and Super moves if meter is available


FALL RECOVERY
 - Allows you to land on your feet after being knocked down


ROLL RECOVERY
 - Allows you to sneak up behind the opponent after being knocked down
 - Completely vulnerable to throws and low attacks
 - Holding forward makes you travel farther


RETREAT
 - Allows you to reposition after being knocked down, thus avoiding the opponent's pressure
 - Cannot be used during a hard knockdown



==========< OTHER INFO >==========

<Selecting the win pose>
(Speech translations by Kibagami)

A -> Morrigan changes her outfit to one of black leather, sits on some bats and says "Mata
asonde ageru wa!" ("I will play again with you!") or "Waruiko ne!" ("Bad boy (girl)!")
X -> Morrigan scratches her head and either giggles or says "Kimochii deshou"("That felt good")
B or Y -> Morrigan releases a bunch of bats and starts hopping and laughing, while the bats
fly around her
C or Z -> Morrigan flips back and changes to a random outfit. Says one of three speeches:
"Denaoshitoide!" ("Come again!"), "Dou? Kirei deshou?" ("So? Am I beautiful?") or
"Mikakedaoshi ne!" ("You're a mere show!")
