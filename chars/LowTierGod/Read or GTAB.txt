=====<Gameplay Notes>=====

COMBO SYSTEM:
 - Can follow up normals with stronger inputs if the button is pressed at the right time
 - Normal attacks can be canceled into Specials and Salt Expressions

GOD TIER FURY:
 - LTG will get angry as he gets hit or is put in a helpless state(being grabbed or knocked down for example)
 - LowTierGod will start flashing indicating he is quite upset.
 - When LTG is salty enough he can perform a Salt Expression. Performing Salt Expressions will reduce his Fury.
 - BEWARE! If Lowtiergod gets too frustrated he will unleash Salt Overload ... KO'ing himself in the process.
SALT EXPRESSIONS:
.Roid Rage:      2000 fury			D, DF, F, D, DF, F, 2k
.Ban Hammer:     1000 fury 		 	D, DF, F, D, DF, F, 2p
.Modder's Block: 1000 fury	                D, DB, B, D, DB, B, 2p
SALT LEVELS:
 1000-1999 = a Dim Orange
 2000-2999 = a bright reddish orange
 3000 & up = a Vibrant Red. You're fucked at this point!
