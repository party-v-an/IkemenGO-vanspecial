==========< GAMEPLAY NOTES >==========

COMBO SYSTEM
 - Some Normal attacks can be canceled into any Special and Super moves
 - Some Special moves can be canceled into any Super moves
 - Some Super moves can be canceled into different Super moves
 - Cancelling a Special, Super or Custom Combo into a Super move resets the juggle points


DAMAGE SCALING
 - The damage your attacks inflict goes down with each attack in a combo
 - The first attack deals 100% damage
 - Successive attacks deal 10% less damage
 - Super cancelling a special advances 2 steps in the damage scaling
 - Super cancelling a super advances 3 steps in the damage scaling
 - Super Combo damage will not fall below 30% for Level 1, 40% for Level 2 and 50% for Level 3
 - Damage during Custom Combo scales according to the damage already dealt to the opponent
 - The amount of power gained during a combo is also affected by damage scaling


THROWS
 - Throws cannot be blocked but can be jumped out of
 - The opponent can escape a normal throw by inputting a throw of their own just as they are grabbed
 - Normally throws can only be escaped if the opponent was in a position where they could also attempt to throw


COUNTER HITS
 - If the opponent is in the middle of attacking, your attacks deal 20% extra damage
 - Most attacks cause extra hit stun as well, allowing links that are normally not possible
 - You'll know a counter hit happened when a round shockwave effect appears at the point of impact


KNOCKDOWNS
 - This character uses 3 types of knockdowns: Soft, Medium and Hard
 - Soft knockdowns allow the enemy to use fall recovery or fast recovery (mash buttons to get up)
 - Medium knockdowns allow only fast recovery
 - Hard knockdowns allow neither. The enemy will always get up with the same timing
 - Hard knockdowns are signalled by a lifebar message (if the lifebars allow it)


FORWARD DASH
 - Moves you forward faster than walking, but you can't interrupt it
 - Useful for sneaking up on the opponent


RUN
 - Can be interrupted unlike dashes


BACK DASH
 - Creates some space between you and the opponent
 - Considered airborne, so it avoids most throws and standing combos


LOW JUMP
 - Useful for quick jumping attacks that must be blocked high
 - Cannot use special and super moves while low jumping
 - Delay after attacking is longer than other jumps


HIGH JUMP
 - Useful for quickly closing distance
 - If the opponent is in the corner, this allows you to cross them up


LONG LOW JUMP
 - A cross between Low and High jumps


SIDESTEP
 - Avoids all attacks and fireballs
 - Vulnerable to throws
 - Instant recovery


SIDESTEP ATTACK
 - Allows you to counterattack after dodging
 - Between the punch and kick options, one can be cancelled into special and super moves, and the other knocks down


ROLL
 - Avoids all attacks and fireballs while moving
 - Vulnerable to throws
 - Can be hit by anything at the end of the animation
 - Forward version is a bit faster than the back version


PARRY
 - Allows you to bypass block stun, leaving the opponent open for a counterattack
 - To parry high attacks tap forward just before being hit. To parry low attacks tap down. While jumping only forward works


POWER CHARGE
 - Manually charges the power meter
 - Rate of charge is slow at first, but increases the longer you hold it


GUARD CANCEL
 - While guarding, this cancels out of the guarding pose with a counterattack
 - Subtracts 300 points from the guard bar (if guard break is enabled)
 - Cannot be used to finish off the opponent
 - Useful to relieve pressure


CUSTOM COMBO
 - Removes most cancellable attack restrictions and gives you a lot of freedom to perform combos
 - Juggle limits are temporarily disabled
 - You can only use Super moves from the point the character starts flashing faster and brighter, and doing so ends Custom Combo
 - Gives you a short invulnerability window at the start


FALL RECOVERY
 - Allows you to land on your feet after being knocked down
