==========< MOVE DETAILS >==========

 - Zugai Hasatsu is an overhead

 - Tenma Kuujin Kyaku must be performed at the apex of a forward jump

 - You can cancel crouching fierce with a jump to start an Aerial Rave

 - You can adjust the trajectory of Messatsu Gou Rasen and Messatsu Gou Senpuu by holding forward or backward

 - Tenshou Kaireki Jin can be performed during Ashura Senkuu



==========< GAMEPLAY NOTES >==========

COMBO SYSTEM
 - Normal attacks can be chained in this order: X, A, Y, B, Z, C
 - Some Normal attacks can be canceled into any Special and Super moves
 - Some Special moves can be canceled into any Super moves
 - Some Super moves can be canceled into different Super moves
 - Cancelling a Special, Super or Custom Combo into a Super move resets the juggle points


DAMAGE SCALING
 - The damage your attacks inflict goes down with each attack in a combo
 - The first attack deals 100% damage
 - Successive attacks deal 10% less damage
 - Super cancelling a special advances 2 steps in the damage scaling
 - Super cancelling a super advances 3 steps in the damage scaling
 - Super Combo damage will not fall below 30% for Level 1, 40% for Level 2 and 50% for Level 3
 - Damage during Custom Combo scales according to the damage already dealt to the opponent
 - Normal attacks deal more damage on their own than during a Chain Combo
 - The amount of power gained during a combo is also affected by damage scaling


THROWS
 - Throws cannot be blocked but can be jumped out of
 - The opponent can escape a normal throw by inputting a throw of their own just as they are grabbed
 - Normally throws can only be escaped if the opponent was in a position where they could also attempt to throw


COUNTER HITS
 - If the opponent is in the middle of attacking, your attacks deal 20% extra damage
 - Most attacks cause extra hit stun as well, allowing links that are normally not possible
 - You'll know a counter hit happened when a round shockwave effect appears at the point of impact


KNOCKDOWNS
 - This character uses 3 types of knockdowns: Soft, Medium and Hard
 - Soft knockdowns allow the enemy to use fall recovery or fast recovery (mash buttons to get up)
 - Medium knockdowns allow only fast recovery
 - Hard knockdowns allow neither. The enemy will always get up with the same timing
 - Hard knockdowns are signalled by a lifebar message (if the lifebars allow it)


FORWARD DASH
 - Moves you forward faster than walking, but you can't interrupt it
 - Useful for sneaking up on the opponent


RUN
 - Can be interrupted unlike dashes


BACK DASH
 - Creates some space between you and the opponent
 - Considered airborne, so it avoids most throws and standing combos


LOW JUMP
 - Useful for quick jumping attacks that must be blocked high
 - Cannot use special and super moves while low jumping
 - Delay after attacking is longer than other jumps


HIGH JUMP
 - Useful for quickly closing distance
 - If the opponent is in the corner, this allows you to cross them up


LONG LOW JUMP
 - A cross between Low and High jumps


SIDESTEP
 - Avoids all attacks and fireballs
 - Vulnerable to throws
 - Instant recovery


SIDESTEP ATTACK
 - Allows you to counterattack after dodging
 - Between the punch and kick options, one can be cancelled into special and super moves, and the other knocks down


ROLL
 - Avoids all attacks and fireballs while moving
 - Vulnerable to throws
 - Can be hit by anything at the end of the animation
 - Forward version is a bit faster than the back version


PARRY
 - Allows you to bypass block stun, leaving the opponent open for a counterattack
 - To parry high attacks tap forward just before being hit. To parry low attacks tap down. While jumping only forward works


POWER CHARGE
 - Manually charges the power meter
 - Rate of charge is slow at first, but increases the longer you hold it


GUARD CANCEL
 - While guarding, this cancels out of the guarding pose with a counterattack
 - Subtracts 300 points from the guard bar (if guard break is enabled)
 - Cannot be used to finish off the opponent
 - Useful to relieve pressure


CUSTOM COMBO
 - Removes most cancellable attack restrictions and gives you a lot of freedom to perform combos
 - Juggle limits are temporarily disabled
 - You can only use Super moves from the point the character starts flashing faster and brighter, and doing so ends Custom Combo
 - Gives you a short invulnerability window at the start


FALL RECOVERY
 - Allows you to land on your feet after being knocked down


ROLL RECOVERY
 - Allows you to sneak up behind the opponent after being knocked down
 - Completely vulnerable to throws and low attacks
 - Cannot be used during a hard knockdown
 - Holding forward makes you travel farther

while saying "Orokana!" (You fool!).

 - Cleaned up the Kongou Kokuretsu Zan sprite edits a bit
 - Can now cancel into Zenpou Tenshin, Hyakki Shuu and Tenma Shurettou
 - Tenma Shinzui Heki deals even less damage, because you can add any attack after it to reach
or even surpass Lv1 Super damage, not to mention resetting air combos to the ground
 - Can no longer use more than one Gou Shoryuken in a juggle (previously combos like 
Shoryuken -> Super -> Shoryuken were too powerful), unless of course you use Tenma Shinzui Heki
to get a free juggle
 - Changed the damage of his main specials to CFJ values, SFA2 values (or was it 3...) were too
high considering what my version can do

it'll always either beat it or trade hits

the opponent touches the ground

 - Can no longer be dizzied

damage while his supers do less
 - His taunt now only increases the damage for one hit, like in SF3 (doesn't work with Misogi
and projectiles though)
 - Attacks now ignore juggle points when OTG'ing the opponent. I didn't spot any infinite caused
by this, but let me know if you do
 - Changed how to combo from Hyakki Gou Sai, it can now only be canceled with Supers, but still
allows juggling with specials


<v.2.5>
 - Tweaking, bug fixes and balance changes
 - Made his A.I. a bit more like in his game appearances, you'll now see him using his specials
