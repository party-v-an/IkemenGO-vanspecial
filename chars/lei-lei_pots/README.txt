==========< MOVE DETAILS >==========

 - The order of the items thrown by Ankihou is random, random, shuriken, statue or panda, dizzying item;

 - Charging Ankihou makes it advance faster through the sequence;

 - The light version of Ankihou never throws dizzying items, unless it was charged;

 - Senpuubu can be done twice in a row, while Lei-Lei is still in the air;

 - Henkyouki can reflect projectiles;

 - Zampa is Lei-Lei's pursuit attack, so it can only be done while her opponent is lying down;

 - Chuukadan timer depends on which buttons were used when performing the move;

 - The Chuukadan bomb can be hit around by any player. However, when it explodes it can also
damage any player, Lei-Lei included;

 - Tenraiha must be blocked high



==========< GAMEPLAY NOTES >==========

COMBO SYSTEM
 - Normal attacks can be chained in this order: X, A, Y, B, Z, C
 - Some Normal attacks can be canceled into any Special and Super moves
 - Some Special moves can be canceled into any Super moves
 - Some Super moves can be canceled into different Super moves
 - Cancelling a Special or Super move into a Super move resets the juggle points


DAMAGE SCALING
 - The damage your attacks inflict goes down with each attack in a combo
 - The first attack deals 100% damage
 - Successive attacks deal 10% less damage
 - Super cancelling a special advances 2 steps in the damage scaling
 - Super cancelling a super advances 3 steps in the damage scaling
 - Super Combo damage will not fall below 30% for Level 1, 40% for Level 2 and 50% for Level 3
 - Normal attacks deal more damage on their own than during a Chain Combo
 - The amount of power gained during a combo is also affected by damage scaling


THROWS
 - Throws cannot be blocked but can be jumped out of
 - The opponent can escape a normal throw by inputting a throw of their own just as they are grabbed
 - Normally throws can only be escaped if the opponent was in a position where they could also attempt to throw


COUNTER HITS
 - If the opponent is in the middle of attacking, your attacks deal 20% extra damage
 - Most attacks cause extra hit stun as well, allowing links that are normally not possible
 - You'll know a counter hit happened when a round shockwave effect appears at the point of impact


KNOCKDOWNS
 - This character uses 3 types of knockdowns: Soft, Medium and Hard
 - Soft knockdowns allow the enemy to use fall recovery or fast recovery (mash buttons to get up)
 - Medium knockdowns allow only fast recovery
 - Hard knockdowns allow neither. The enemy will always get up with the same timing
 - Hard knockdowns are signalled by a lifebar message (if the lifebars allow it)


FORWARD DASH
 - Lei-Lei's dash is special. She will cycle between being visible and invisible
 - While invisible she is also invulnerable


BACK DASH
 - Creates some space between you and the opponent
 - Considered airborne, so it avoids most throws and standing combos


HIGH JUMP
 - Useful for quickly closing distance
 - If the opponent is in the corner, this allows you to cross them up


ROLL
 - Avoids all attacks and fireballs while moving
 - Vulnerable to throws
 - Can be hit by anything at the end of the animation
 - Forward version is a bit faster than the back version


POWER CHARGE
 - Manually charges the power meter
 - Rate of charge is slow at first, but increases the longer you hold it


GUARD CANCEL
 - While guarding, this cancels out of the guarding pose with a counterattack
 - Subtracts 300 points from the guard bar (if guard break is enabled)
 - Cannot be used to finish off the opponent
 - Useful to relieve pressure


DARK FORCE
 - Completely invulnerable while starting
 - Lei-Lei gains hyper armor, so she becomes very hard to deal with
 - Invulnerable to throws
 - Can be ended early by repeating the input
 - Completely vulnerable while ending
 - The farther away she is from Lin-Lin, the longer she will be vulnerable


FALL RECOVERY
 - Allows you to land on your feet after being knocked down


RETREAT
 - Allows you to reposition after being knocked down, thus avoiding the opponent's pressure
 - Cannot be used during a hard knockdown
